# Workflow: Deploy Notes AI Feature to Netlify

This workflow outlines the steps required to deploy the **Notes AI** feature of the TerraOSai application to Netlify.

## Prerequisites
1. **Netlify account** with a site created for the TerraOSai repository.
2. **GitHub repository** linked to the Netlify site.
3. **OpenAI API key** (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) stored as a Netlify environment variable.
4. Local development environment with `git` and `npm` installed.

## Steps
1. **Pull the latest changes**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. **Install dependencies** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Verify the Notes AI feature works locally**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Open `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown) and test the Notes AI functionality.
4. **Add/Update Netlify environment variable**
   - Go to **Site Settings → Build & Deploy → Environment → Environment variables**.
   - Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set with your OpenAI secret key.
5. **Commit any changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare Notes AI feature for Netlify deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```
6. **Trigger a Netlify build**
   - Netlify will automatically start a build on push. If you need to trigger manually, go to **Deploys → Trigger deploy → Deploy site**.
7. **Verify deployment**
   - Once the build succeeds, visit the Netlify site URL.
   - Test the Notes AI feature to ensure it works in the production environment.
8. **Monitor logs for errors**
   - In Netlify, check **Deploy logs** for any build or runtime errors.
   - If errors occur, fix locally, commit, and push again.

## Optional: Automate with Netlify CLI (Turbo)
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI globally if not installed
npm install -g netlify-cli
# Login to Netlify
netlify login
# Deploy manually
netlify deploy --prod --dir=out
```
